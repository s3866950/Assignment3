As in Assignment 2, you need to have a group website and a GitHub (or similar) repository for your group. In your report you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following:
- The link to your group’s website - The link to your group’s Git repository (GitHub, BitBucket, etc) - Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.
